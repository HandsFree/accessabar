# What is ACE?
ACE is a toolbar that provides a range of features to make any website accessible. 

Accessibility is becoming more important every day in today's internet landscape. 
Websites are becoming more creative, laden with images and fancy animations, all packed into a javascript rendered frontend.
Whilst this is great for most, it can sometimes alienate the disabled.

ACE pairs with any website to make it accessible to everyone.
